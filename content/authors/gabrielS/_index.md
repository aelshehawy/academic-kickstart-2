I graduated in Lecce, Italy, at University of Salento in 2011. I wrote my thesis under the supervision of Rosario Antonio Leo (University of Salento) and Piergiulio Tempesta (Universidad Complutense de Madrid).

I later obtained my PhD at the University of Pisa in 2015, under the supervision of Sergio Caracciolo (University of Milan & SNS). You can find the manuscript of my PhD thesis here.

After a two-year postdoc in the Centro Brasileiro de Pesquisas Físicas in Rio de Janeiro, I have been post-doctoral researcher in Statistical Physics at Sapienza Università di Roma, in the group of Giorgio Parisi. Now I am postdoc at the École normale supérieure in Paris with Florent Krzakala.
