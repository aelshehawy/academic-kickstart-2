abstract: "This memoir is a summary of my research in the past few years on the statistical physics of disordered systems. It is divided into four parts. The first part deals with the methods and models of disordered systems and their static, equilibrium description, while the second discusses the dynamical description. The next parts are applications of these methods: part three deals with the glass transition and the jamming phenomena, while part four is dedicated to interdisciplinary applications in constraint optimization in computer science, quantum al- gorithms, and Bayesian inference."
