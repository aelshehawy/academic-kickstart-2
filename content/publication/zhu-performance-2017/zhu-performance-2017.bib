 abstract = {Compressed sensing (CS) demonstrates that sparse signals can be estimated from underdetermined linear systems. Distributed CS (DCS) further reduces the number of measurements by considering joint sparsity within signal ensembles. DCS with jointly sparse signals has applications in multisensor acoustic sensing, magnetic resonance imaging with multiple coils, remote sensing, and array signal processing. Multimeasurement vector (MMV) problems consider the estimation of jointly sparse signals under the DCS framework. Two related MMV settings are studied. In the first setting, each signal vector is measured by a different independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) measurement matrix, while in the second setting, all signal vectors are measured by the same i.i.d. matrix. Replica analysis is performed for these two MMV settings, and the minimum mean squared error (MMSE), which turns out to be identical for both settings, is obtained as a function of the noise variance and number of measurements. To showcase the application of MMV models, the MMSE's of complex CS problems with both real and complex measurement matrices are also analyzed. Multiple performance regions for MMV are identified where the MMSE behaves differently as a function of the noise variance and the number of measurements. Belief propagation (BP) is a CS signal estimation framework that often achieves the MMSE asymptotically. A phase transition for BP is identified. This phase transition, verified by numerical results, separates the regions where BP achieves the MMSE and where it is suboptimal. Numerical results also illustrate that more signal vectors in the jointly sparse signal ensemble lead to a better phase transition.},
