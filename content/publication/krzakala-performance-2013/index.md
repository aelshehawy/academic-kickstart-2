abstract: "We perform careful numerical simulations of slow Monte-Carlo annealings in the dense 3-body spin glass model and compare with the predictions from different theories: thresholds states, isocomplexity, following state. We conclude that while isocomplexity and following state both provide excellent agreement the numerical data, the influence of threshold states – that is still the most commonly considered theory – can be excluded from our data."
