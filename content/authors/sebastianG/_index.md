# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: The main theme of Sebastian's current research is to understand how neural networks manage to perform well, even in regimes where classical learning theory would predict them to fail. Being a theoretical physicist by training, he uses concepts and tools from statistical physics to build models for the key drivers of generalisation of neural networks and analyses their interplay. Before joining the SPHINX group, Sebastian was a post-doc in the group of [Lenka Zdeborová](http://artax.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~zdebl9am/) at IPhT in Paris. He studied physics at the University of Cambridge and received his PhD from the University of Stuttgart, where he worked on the stochastic thermodynamics of learning under the supervision of Udo Seifert.
