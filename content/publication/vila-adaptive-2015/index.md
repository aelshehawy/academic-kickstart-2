abstract: "The generalized approximate message passing (GAMP) algorithm is an efficient method of MAP or approximate-MMSE estimation of x observed from a noisy version of the transform coefficients z = Ax. In fact, for large zero-mean i.i.d sub-Gaussian A, GAMP is characterized by a state evolution whose fixed points, when unique, are optimal. For generic A, however, GAMP may diverge. In this paper, we propose adaptive-damping and mean-removal strategies that aim to prevent divergence. Numerical results demonstrate significantly enhanced robustness to non-zero-mean, rank-deficient, column-correlated, and ill-conditioned A."
