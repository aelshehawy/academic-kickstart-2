 abstract = {This paper investigates experimental means of measuring the transmission matrix (TM) of a highly scattering medium, with the simplest optical setup. Spatial light modulation is performed by a digital micromirror device (DMD), allowing high rates and high pixel counts but only binary amplitude modulation. On the sensor side, without a reference beam, the CCD camera provides only intensity measurements. Within this framework, this paper shows that the TM can still be retrieved, through signal processing techniques of phase retrieval. This is experimentally validated on three criteria : quality of prediction, distribution of singular values, and quality of focusing.},
