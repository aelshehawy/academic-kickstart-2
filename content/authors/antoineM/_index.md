I am a PhD student in Ecole Normale Supérieure de Paris under the supervision of Florent Krzakala and Lenka Zdeborová. My research is at the intersection of high-dimensional statistics, statistical physics, information theory and random matrix theory. In fall 2019 I am also a teaching assistant for the course Mathematics for Physicists at the physics department of Ecole Normale Supérieure.
