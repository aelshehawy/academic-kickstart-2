 abstract = {This paper addresses fundamental scaling issues that hinder phase retrieval (PR) in high dimensions. We show that, if the measurement matrix can be put into a generalized block-diagonal form, a large PR problem can be solved on separate blocks, at the cost of a few extra global measurements to merge the partial results. We illustrate this principle using two distinct PR methods, and discuss different design trade-offs. Experimental results indicate that this block-based PR framework can reduce computational cost and memory requirements by several orders of magnitude.},
