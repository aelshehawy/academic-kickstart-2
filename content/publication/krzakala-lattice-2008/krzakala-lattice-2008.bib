 abstract = {We study a lattice model of attractive colloids. It is exactly solvable on sparse random graphs. As the pressure and temperature are varied, it reproduces many characteristic phenomena of liquids, glasses, and colloidal systems such as ideal gel formation, liquid-glass phase coexistence, jamming, or the reentrance of the glass transition.},
